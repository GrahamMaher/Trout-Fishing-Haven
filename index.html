                <h3>Freshwater Trout Fishing</h3>
                <p>Freshwater trout fishing is a beloved pastime for anglers of all ages. Trout, including species like
                    rainbow, brown, and brook trout, thrive in cold, clear streams, rivers, and lakes. The experience is
                    enhanced by the tranquil surroundings, often characterized by lush forests, flowing water, and the
                    sounds of wildlife. Besides the challenge of hooking a wary trout, fishing enthusiasts appreciate
                    the opportunity to disconnect from daily stresses and immerse themselves in nature.</p>

                <h3>Methods and Bait used</h3>
                <div>
                    <h4>Fly Fishing:</h4>
                    <h5>Dry Fly Fishing:</h5>
                    <p>Uses floating flies to mimic adult insects on the water's surface.
                        Anglers cast upstream and let the fly drift naturally.</p>
                    <h5>Nymph Fishing:</h5>
                    <p>Involves sinking flies that imitate the underwater stage of insects.
                        Nymphs are drifted near the bottom of the stream or river.</p>
                    <h5>Streamer Fishing:</h5>
                    <p>Uses larger, sinking flies that imitate baitfish or leeches. Streamers are
                        retrieved with varying speeds and patterns to entice strikes from larger trout.</p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <div>
                    <h4>Spin Fishing:</h4>
                    <h5>Using Lures:</h5>
                    <p>Small spinners, spoons, and crankbaits can be very effective for trout.
                        These lures mimic the movement of small fish and insects.</p>
                    <h5>Using Bait:</h5>
                    <p>Worms, minnows, and artificial baits like PowerBait are commonly used.
                        Baits are typically fished with a bobber or on the bottom with a weight.</p>

                <br>
                <div>
                    <h4>Trolling:</h4>
                    <p>Trolling involves slowly dragging lures or bait behind a moving boat. This method covers a lot
                        of water and is particularly effective in lakes and large rivers.</p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <div>
                    <h4>Drift Fishing:</h4>
                    <p>Drift fishing involves casting upstream and letting the bait or lure drift naturally with the
                        current. This technique is effective in rivers and streams, allowing the bait to cover a lot of
                        water.</p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <div>
                    <h4>Still Fishing:</h4>
                    <p>This method is typically used in lakes and ponds. Anglers cast their bait or lures and let them
                        sit still, waiting for trout to come by and bite. It's a relaxed approach that can be effective
                        with
                        both natural and artificial baits.</p>
